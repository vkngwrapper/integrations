# SDL2 Integration v3

`go get github.com/vkngwrapper/integrations/sdl2/v3`

This integration provides a small utility to create khr_surface.Surface objects from Window options created
 with [go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2). In order to use this integration, you will need to install
 SDL2 to your local system using the instructions [here](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2#requirements).

You can look at [examples](https://github.com/vkngwrapper/examples/tree/main/vulkan_tutorial/sdl2) to see
 the most effective way to use SDL2 in your vkngwrapper application.
